## ThaiFood
#### Application that helps foreigners in Thailand to get their favorite meal from a local foodstall where is no English menu.
  
React frontend for my ThaiFood application.
I am learning React while creating this project, although I hope other people will use it in the future.

Idea for the project was born after I met other foreigner at local foodstal in Thailand. He could not order a meal that he wanted becasue of lack of Thai language knowledge.
Few days later I had a class at university "IT Planning and Project Management" and we had to group with others to do a project on a fictional application that will help other people in everyday life. More about the project is here:

My main scope is to deliver application where user can compose meals, add them to the order and translate it to Thai language to show at local foodstal and get his favourite food.
  
Application is connected to my RESTful API created with Node.js that I am learning too.
